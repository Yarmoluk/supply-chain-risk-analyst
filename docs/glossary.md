# Glossary

## A

**Adaptive Capacity**
: The ability of an organization or supply chain to adjust to changing conditions, learn from disruptions, and evolve strategies and processes in response to new challenges.

## B

**BCP (Business Continuity Planning)**
: The process of creating systems of prevention and recovery to deal with potential threats to a company, ensuring continuity of critical operations during and after disruptions.

**Blockchain**
: A distributed ledger technology that records transactions across multiple computers in a tamper-proof, transparent manner, useful for supply chain traceability and multi-party coordination.

**Bottleneck Supplier**
: A supplier with limited alternatives despite relatively lower spend, creating dependency and requiring focused risk management despite lower financial value.

**Bullwhip Effect**
: The phenomenon where demand variability amplifies as orders move upstream in the supply chain, from retailers to wholesalers to manufacturers to suppliers.

## C

**Control Tower**
: A centralized hub for supply chain visibility, monitoring, coordination, and decision-making, providing real-time oversight of network operations and enabling rapid response to disruptions.

**Cycle Stock**
: Normal inventory held to meet expected demand between replenishment cycles, distinct from safety stock held as buffer against uncertainty.

## D

**Days Sales Outstanding (DSO)**
: A financial metric measuring the average number of days it takes a company to collect payment after a sale, indicating cash flow efficiency and potential financial stress.

**Demand Sensing**
: The use of advanced analytics and real-time data to detect short-term changes in demand patterns, enabling more accurate forecasts and responsive supply planning.

**Digital Twin**
: A virtual replica of a physical asset, process, or system that uses real-time data and simulation to mirror behavior, enabling testing and optimization without disrupting actual operations.

**Dual-Sourcing**
: A sourcing strategy that maintains qualified suppliers in different geographic regions for the same component, providing redundancy and insurance against regional disruptions.

## E

**Early Warning System**
: A monitoring system that detects signals indicating risks are materializing, enabling proactive response before major disruptions occur.

## F

**FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis)**
: A systematic methodology for identifying potential failure points, assessing their consequences and likelihood, and prioritizing mitigation efforts based on risk priority numbers.

**Force Majeure**
: A contract clause that frees parties from liability when extraordinary events beyond their control (natural disasters, war, pandemics) prevent contract fulfillment.

**Freight Forwarder**
: A logistics service provider that arranges transportation and documentation for international shipments, acting as intermediary between shippers and carriers.

## I

**Incoterms (International Commercial Terms)**
: Standardized trade terms published by the International Chamber of Commerce defining responsibilities, costs, and risks between buyers and sellers in international transactions.

**ISO 28000**
: International standard specifying requirements for security management systems in supply chains, applicable to organizations involved in any aspect of the supply chain.

**ISO 31000**
: International standard providing principles and guidelines for risk management applicable across all organizational contexts and risk types.

## J

**Just-in-Case (JIC)**
: An inventory strategy that maintains buffer stock to protect against supply disruptions, prioritizing resilience over efficiency compared to just-in-time approaches.

**Just-in-Time (JIT)**
: An inventory strategy that minimizes stock by receiving goods only as needed for production or sales, reducing carrying costs but increasing vulnerability to disruptions.

## K

**Kanban**
: A visual scheduling and inventory control system using cards or signals to trigger replenishment only when inventory reaches predetermined levels, enabling pull-based production.

## L

**Lead Time**
: The time between initiating a process (placing an order, starting production) and its completion (receiving goods, finishing production), a critical factor in inventory planning.

**Lean Supply Chain**
: A supply chain strategy focused on eliminating waste, reducing inventory, and maximizing efficiency, though potentially at the expense of resilience to disruptions.

**Logistics**
: The process of planning, implementing, and controlling the movement and storage of goods, services, and information from origin to consumption.

## M

**Multi-Source**
: A sourcing strategy using multiple suppliers for the same component to reduce dependency, increase competition, and provide redundancy against supplier failures.

## N

**Nearshoring**
: The practice of sourcing from suppliers in nearby or neighboring countries rather than distant regions, reducing lead times and geopolitical risk compared to offshoring.

## O

**Offshoring**
: The practice of sourcing from suppliers in distant countries, typically to reduce costs through lower labor rates and economies of scale.

## P

**PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)**
: A cyclical methodology for continual improvement involving planning objectives, implementing actions, checking results, and acting on findings to drive enhancement.

**Procurement**
: The process of finding, acquiring, and buying goods and services from external sources, including supplier selection, negotiation, and contract management.

## R

**Reshoring**
: The practice of returning production or sourcing from overseas locations to domestic operations, often motivated by risk reduction or total cost considerations.

**Resilience**
: The capacity of a supply chain to absorb disruptions, adapt to changing conditions, and recover rapidly to desired performance levels.

**Risk Matrix**
: A visual tool for prioritizing risks based on their probability and impact, typically using a grid format with different zones indicating priority levels.

**Risk Priority Number (RPN)**
: In FMEA, a calculated value (Severity × Occurrence × Detection) used to rank failure modes for prioritization of mitigation efforts.

**Risk Register**
: A structured document cataloging identified risks with details including description, likelihood, impact, ownership, and mitigation strategies.

**RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**
: The maximum acceptable amount of data loss or production loss measured in time, guiding backup frequency and inventory buffer decisions.

**RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**
: The target time for restoring a function or service after a disruption, based on business impact analysis and used to guide resilience investment.

## S

**Safety Stock**
: Inventory held as buffer against uncertainty in demand or supply, sized to achieve desired service levels given variability and lead times.

**Single-Source**
: A sourcing strategy relying on one supplier for a component, enabling deeper partnerships and volume benefits but creating concentration risk.

**Strategic Stock**
: Deliberate excess inventory held for high-risk components as insurance against known vulnerabilities such as single-source dependency or long lead times.

**Supply Chain Risk**
: The likelihood and impact of unexpected events or conditions that negatively affect any part of the supply chain, from raw material sourcing through final delivery.

**Supply Chain Visibility**
: The ability to track and access data about products, materials, and information as they move through the supply chain, enabling proactive management and rapid response.

## T

**Tier-1 Supplier**
: A supplier that provides goods or services directly to the buying organization, as opposed to tier-2 suppliers who supply to tier-1 suppliers.

**Tier-2 Supplier**
: A supplier that provides goods or services to tier-1 suppliers rather than directly to the end organization, representing second level in the supply network.

**Time to Recovery (TTR)**
: The time elapsed from a disruption occurrence to restoration of normal operations, a key resilience metric.

**Time to Survive (TTS)**
: The duration an organization can continue operations if inputs stop, based on inventory buffers and alternative sources.

## V

**VMI (Vendor Managed Inventory)**
: An inventory management approach where the supplier monitors and replenishes inventory at the customer's location, transferring planning responsibility upstream.

## W

**Warehouse Management System (WMS)**
: Software application supporting warehouse operations including receiving, put-away, picking, packing, and shipping, providing inventory visibility and control.

## Z

**Z-Score (Altman Z-Score)**
: A financial metric predicting bankruptcy probability using multiple financial ratios, useful for assessing supplier financial health and stability risk.
