# Chapter 3: ISO 28000 Framework

## Introduction

ISO 28000 provides the international standard for security management systems in supply chains. Published by the International Organization for Standardization, it establishes requirements for assessing and managing security risks across the entire supply chain. This chapter examines the standard's structure, implementation methodology, and relationship to other management system standards.

## ISO 28000 Structure and Scope

ISO 28000:2007, revised in 2022, specifies requirements for a security management system applicable to organizations of all sizes involved in any aspect of the supply chain. The standard applies to manufacturing, service, storage, and transportation organizations at any production or supply stage.

### Core Principles

The standard is built on several fundamental principles:

1. **Risk-based approach**: Security measures proportional to assessed risks
2. **Process methodology**: Systematic, repeatable procedures
3. **Continual improvement**: Ongoing enhancement of security performance
4. **Management commitment**: Leadership engagement and resource allocation
5. **Competence and awareness**: Trained personnel understanding their security roles

!!! info "Standard Definition"
    ISO 28000 defines a security management system as "that part of the overall management system, based on a business risk approach, to establish and maintain security."

### Standard Components

The standard is organized into key sections:

| Section | Content | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Context of the Organization** | Understanding organizational and supply chain context | Define scope and boundaries |
| **Leadership** | Management commitment, policy, roles | Establish governance |
| **Planning** | Risk assessment, objectives, planning | Identify and prioritize security needs |
| **Support** | Resources, competence, communication, documentation | Enable implementation |
| **Operation** | Operational planning, security controls | Execute security measures |
| **Performance Evaluation** | Monitoring, measurement, audit, review | Assess effectiveness |
| **Improvement** | Nonconformity, corrective action, continual improvement | Drive enhancement |

## Security Management System Fundamentals

A security management system (SMS) provides systematic framework for managing supply chain security risks. Unlike ad-hoc security measures, an SMS integrates security into organizational processes and culture.

### Security Policy

The security policy articulates organizational commitment to supply chain security. It should:

- State the purpose and scope of security management
- Include commitment to meet legal and regulatory requirements
- Provide framework for setting security objectives
- Include commitment to continual improvement
- Be communicated throughout the organization and to relevant interested parties

!!! example "Sample Policy Statement"
    "XYZ Corporation commits to protecting the security and integrity of our supply chain through systematic risk management, compliance with international standards, and continual improvement of our security management system."

### Security Risk Assessment

ISO 28000 requires organizations to establish, implement, and maintain processes for assessing security risks. This includes:

**Identifying threats and vulnerabilities**
- Physical security threats (theft, tampering, terrorism)
- Cyber security threats (hacking, data breaches, ransomware)
- Operational threats (fraud, counterfeiting, unauthorized access)
- Natural and environmental threats

**Assessing likelihood and consequences**
- Probability of threat occurrence
- Potential impact on operations, reputation, compliance
- Velocity and cascading effects

**Determining risk acceptability**
- Risk appetite and tolerance levels
- Prioritization criteria
- Resource allocation decisions

**Identifying risk treatment options**
- Avoid, reduce, transfer, or accept risks
- Preventive vs detective vs corrective controls
- Cost-benefit analysis of treatment options

## PDCA Cycle Application

ISO 28000 adopts the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle for continual improvement. This methodology enables systematic enhancement of security performance.

    C1[Monitor performance<br/>Conduct audits<br/>Review effectiveness] --> C
    D1[Corrective actions<br/>Process improvements<br/>Update controls] --> D
```

### Plan Phase

**Establish security objectives**: Define measurable targets aligned with organizational strategy and risk assessment outcomes.

**Examples:**
- Reduce security incidents by 25% within 12 months
- Achieve 100% supplier security certification within 24 months
- Implement access controls at all warehouses by Q3

**Develop security plan**: Document how objectives will be achieved, including:
- Specific security controls and procedures
- Resource requirements (budget, personnel, technology)
- Responsibilities and authorities
- Timeline and milestones
- Performance indicators

### Do Phase

**Implement security controls**: Deploy planned measures across operations:

- Physical security (access controls, surveillance, secure storage)
- Personnel security (background checks, training, awareness programs)
- Information security (encryption, access management, data protection)
- Transportation security (route planning, driver verification, tracking)
- Supplier security (qualification criteria, audits, contractual requirements)

**Ensure competence**: Train personnel on security procedures and their roles in the SMS.

**Maintain documentation**: Record evidence of implementation for audit and review.

### Check Phase

**Monitor and measure**: Track security performance against objectives:

- Incident frequency and severity
- Security audit findings
- Compliance with procedures
- Cost of security measures
- Effectiveness of controls

**Conduct internal audits**: Systematic examination of SMS implementation:
- Assess conformity with ISO 28000 requirements
- Evaluate effectiveness of security controls
- Identify nonconformities and improvement opportunities
- Verify documentation and records

**Management review**: Senior leadership periodically evaluates SMS:
- Overall security performance trends
- Audit results and corrective actions
- Changes in internal/external context
- Resource adequacy
- Improvement opportunities

### Act Phase

**Address nonconformities**: When security requirements are not met:
- Investigate root causes
- Implement corrective actions
- Verify effectiveness of corrections
- Update procedures to prevent recurrence

**Continual improvement**: Systematically enhance security performance:
- Implement lessons learned from incidents
- Adopt emerging security technologies
- Refine risk assessment methodologies
- Enhance training programs
- Update controls based on threat evolution
